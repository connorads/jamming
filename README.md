* Populate Results List â€” Jammming displays the list of returned tracks from the userâ€™s query.
* Add Song to a Custom Playlist â€” users can add a track to their playlist by selecting a + sign on the right side of the trackâ€™s display container.
* Remove Song from Custom Playlist â€” users can remove a track from their playlist by selecting a - sign on the right side of the trackâ€™s display container.

## Potential improvements

* ~~Pressing enter triggers a search~~
* Include preview samples for each track
* Only display songs not currently present in the playlist in the search results
* Add a loading screen while playlist is saving
* Update the access token logic to expire at exactly the right time

* Ensure playlist information doesnâ€™t get cleared if a user has to refresh their access token

## Codecademy Instructions

### Intro

> In this project, you will build a React web application called Jammming. You will use your knowledge of React components, state, and requests with the Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

### Resources

> Because we want you to focus on building the React infrastructure, we have provided links to the HTML/CSS and visual assets below. Notice, we did not break the HTML and CSS into their components. To complete the project you will need to split the HTML/CSS into their components.

* [index.html](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/programs/react/jammming/static-html-css/indexHtml.txt) â€” all of the HTML for a static version of the website.
* [style.css](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/programs/react/jammming/static-html-css/indexCss.txt) â€” all of the CSS for a static version of the website.
* [image assets](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/programs/react/jammming/image_assets.zip) â€” all of the image assets used in the website.
